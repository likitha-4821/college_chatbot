# college_chatbot
This SVECW College Chatbot is an interactive AI-powered assistant designed to provide instant and accurate responses to students' queries about the college. Built using Streamlit, Google Gemini AI, and machine learning techniques, the chatbot leverages TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find the closest matching question from a predefined dataset. If a relevant match is found, it retrieves the corresponding answer; otherwise, it generates a response using Google's Gemini AI for a more dynamic and flexible interaction. The chatbot features a clean and user-friendly interface, maintaining conversation history throughout the session. It also handles missing or incorrect data gracefully by ensuring the CSV-based knowledge base is well-processed. This tool serves as an efficient and intelligent solution for students to access information about the college, academic programs, admission procedures, campus facilities, and more, providing a seamless experience for users.
